# API Usage
The WeatherNow App t uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather. OpenWeatherMap API is free to use for smaller-scale applications. Large applications with bigger user bases may need to opt into one of the paid plans in order to satisfy the higher call–per-minute needs. The free tier comes with the following restrictions:
1,200 API calls per minute
Weather history no greater than five day 
95% up time
Weather data updates every 3 hours
No SSL
If you need more calls per minute, increased up time, more frequent weather updates, or secured access, you’ll need to pay subscription. Regardless of which tier you decide to use, you need to register an API key for your application. To do this, register your application by signing up for an account. Once logged in, you can find the key under the setup tab. Since the API is public access, the key needs to be added as a parameter to whatever API endpoint you send a request to.

# Testing
We employed two testing tools to ensure the error-free nature of our code. we utilized validator testing tools, such as:
1. Nu Html Checker (w3.org): identifies potential issues affecting webpage functionality.
2. W3C CSS Validator for TextArea (CSS level 3 + SVG): identifies and highlighting errors or warnings that may impact the styling of our web pages.

During the validation process, errors were detected, signifying areas for improvement. Recognizing and addressing these syntax errors is crucial for ongoing development, ensuring our code remains free of potential issues. Moving forward, we are committed to addressing identified problems and to uphold code quality.
